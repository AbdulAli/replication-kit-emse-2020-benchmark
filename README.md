Our research paper ([Link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-020-09878-9)) compares two methods: Herbold method which is time agnostic .vs. Time-wise evaluation method.

The HerboldMethod folder consists of an instruction README.md, dataset and evaluation code for HerboldMethod. <br/>
The Time-awareMethod folder consists of dataset, time-wise evaluation code and R-scripts for data analysis. <br/>



* Instructions for running Herbold Method: [Link](https://github.com/AbdulAli/replication-kit-emse-2020-benchmark/blob/master/HerboldMethod/Readme.md)
* Instructions for generating Time-aware configurations from raw data: [Link](https://github.com/AbdulAli/replication-kit-emse-2020-benchmark/blob/master/Time-awareMethod/DataGeneration/Readme.md)
* Instructions for running Time-aware evaluation: [Link](https://github.com/AbdulAli/replication-kit-emse-2020-benchmark/blob/master/Time-awareMethod/RunningExperiment/Readme.md)
* R-scripts for analyzing the results of time-aware .vs. HerboldMethod: [Link](https://github.com/AbdulAli/replication-kit-emse-2020-benchmark/tree/master/Time-awareMethod/AnalyzingResults)
* Data with class-balancing is available at: [Link](https://github.com/AbdulAli/replication-kit-emse-2020-benchmark/tree/master/Time-awareMethod/BalacedExperiment)
