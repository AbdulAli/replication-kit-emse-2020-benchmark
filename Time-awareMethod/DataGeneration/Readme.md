DataGeneration folder contains all the data and also the tools to generate time-wise configurations data.


1. Jurekzo folder contains FilteredJureczko data set
2. First run LoadingTrainingSet.java to generate Configurations folder
3. Copy the Configurations folder into ConfigsGeneratorProject/ directory
4. Run FlattenConfigurations.java to bring all configurations dataset into AllConfigs/ empty folder inside ConfigsGeneratorProject/ folder.

Note: AllConfigsForGapStrategy already contains all the files for all four configuration. You can simply rename the folder to AllConfigs to avoid beforementioned steps.
